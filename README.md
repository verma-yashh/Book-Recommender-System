Book Recommendation System:

This project implements a book recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques. The system suggests personalized book recommendations based on user ratings.

Features: 

Collaborative filtering: Analyzes user ratings to identify similar preferences and generate accurate book recommendations.
Data preprocessing: Handles merging, missing values, and duplicates to ensure clean and reliable data.
Feature engineering: Identifies users with many ratings and books with enough reviews for improved recommendations.

Future Improvements: 

Enhance content-based filtering by including more book attributes like genre and summaries.
Explore hybrid approaches by combining collaborative and content-based filtering for even better recommendations.
